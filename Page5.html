<H3 align="CENTER" style="color:white;" class= ins> CREATING A IMPACTFUL CLIMATE CRISIS POSTER. 
I utilised a non copy right image of earth on fire to display the severity  of the current global warming situation and bring lite to the increase of wildfires around the globe, using such a harsh image will hopeful bring shock value to the image and become eye grabbing when an audience is viewing it. Implementing the bold text with the red “NOT” is a way to make the message as clear as possible to the viewer that action needs to be taken. The final touches in the image are creating the “SOS” in flames and placing it to look as if its been scorched into the earth and the slogan at the top add extra detail and substance to the image when it is being closer looked at and add depth then adding the organisation/ charity in the bottom right allow the audience to donate and hopefully make a difference.</ins></H3>

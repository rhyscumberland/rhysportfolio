<H1 align="CENTER" style="color:white;" class= ins> THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS</ins></H1>

<H3 align="CENTER" style="color:white;" class= ins>Using extreme saturation and comic like bold outlines allows me to highlight the homeless subjects in each individual images, bring light to how such a common sight in todays world is such an Absurd cruelty of the modern society, forcing peoples eye to the problem and radicalising it to make it appear unnatural and out of place to its Surroundings allows the image to convey the sad reality of subjecting these people to a life on the streets. Using images that display the homeless as sleeping adds extra effect onto the images showing a sense of vulnerability, I believe the photographs I selected where stood out and where powerful to me as a viewer where due to the images display a human being so cold and uncomfortable whilst sleeping that they resorted to using boxes and newspapers to shelter them and provide enough comfort to allow them to fall asleep . Drawing a face on one of the images I edited gives a humorous effect to juxtapose the harsh reality of the situation giving the image a level of confusion as an effort to make the viewer confused and question the strange nature of the image.

I sourced these images from unsplash.com and used a combination of photoshop and procreate to edit them to display my message, utilising photoshop to separate the images to desaturate the background and oversaturate the focus of the images to create a sense of surrealism to the photo, Then importing the image into procreate and outlining the focus point to add further disconnection from the background.</ins></H3>

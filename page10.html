<H1 align="CENTER" style="color:black;" class= ins> The creation of my board game:</ins></H1>
<H2 align="CENTER" style="color:black;" class= ins>Inspiration: </ins></H2>
<H3 align="CENTER" style="color:black;" class= ins>
	I began my research by studying and playing some of the most
popular and best sold games of the last 50 years, I was drawn to
more 1v1 card battling games such as Pokémon, magic the
gathering and top trumps. I like the idea of games without a table
top, to be able to make the product more transportable and
affordable as production costs will be lower due to less printing
being needed to produce the game.
I was specifically interested in making a more refined top trumps
like game but with multiple card being drawn each hand to create
a team similar to Pokémon.</ins></H3>
<H2 align="CENTER" style="color:black;" class= ins> Game concept:</ins></H2>
<H3 align="CENTER" style="color:black;" class= ins>
	Drawing from my inspirations I have come up with a concept of a
game that is going to draw fans from the previous card games but
is a fresh new concept that will entice and excite new and veteran
card game players. I’ve Incorporated my passion for music into
the card game by making the characters on my card are
interpretations of 30 of the most iconic and popular musicians of
the modern era, to make the card game appealing to my target
audience of older children to young adults, 8 to 18 years old I
utilised a more cartoon art style. The rules of the game are, 3
players play against each other by shuffling and splitting the deck
equally then each player draw 4 cards from the deck then
alternate choosing an attribute category of all for cards and
adding them together and comparing the final total of all 4 card
against the opponent whoever has the higher number gets to
choose a card out of the other players hand and add it to the
bottom of their deck, then after each round all cards are retuned
to each players individual decks and are shuffled again, then each
player draws 4 cards again, the game continues as previously
stated until 1 player has all the cards and their opponent has
none.</ins></H3>
<H2 align="CENTER" style="color:black;" class= ins>Card design:</ins></H2>
<H3 align="CENTER" style="color:black;" class= ins>
	The base background design of the cards is a stone wall with gold
framing and red curtains and a red banner to represent a stage
that the “musicians” would theoretically be performing on, also I
have incorporated musical notes for obvious reasons to make the
card design more musically themed, having the notes go across
the card but under the musician creates a level of depth to the
design giving the impression of the musician being a 3D model
coming out of the frame, this is also demonstrated by the
shadows behind the “musicians”. The use of “times new roman”
as the font is to portray a more formal style to look cohesive with
the gold and deep red design elements in the curtain and gold
trim of the card. All cards have 5 attributes, ability, popularity,
swagg, creativity, attitude and a final attribute of an overall of all
the stats added together, each stat is what I believe the real world
musicians. Also added additional information for the musicians
displaying the artist current age or the age they where when they
passed away, and showing the genre of music they play. Each 30
designs of the musicians are stylistically different to fit with the
style of the real life counterparts, some are similar styles as I
believe some musicians have the same style as others. Creating a
spoofed version of each real life musicians image and and name
adds a comedic aspect to the card game that will appeal to my
target audience for the game, but even with an increased
caricature style of each the musicians I believe that I have
captured the likeness of the real life counterparts in each one of
my cards without being to specific, as to avoid copyright
infringement.</ins></H3>
<H2 align="CENTER" style="color:black;" class= ins>Goals for the game:</ins></H2>
<H3 align="CENTER" style="color:black;" class= ins>
	My personal goals for this card game to to create an audience for
cards games and get my target audience the youth interest in card
games as in the modern era card games have been pushed to the
side line and become practically obsolete due to the growing
popularity of video games, I believe it is a shame that the board
game has become a lost art form and is not a common used as
fun recreation for family’s and friends, with an added bonus of
introducing a young audience to new music and musicians
through a fun card game.</ins></H3>
<H2 align="CENTER" style="color:black;" class= ins>Production:</ins></H2>
<H3 align="CENTER" style="color:black;" class= ins>
	After designing all the cards digitally I have been able to double
side print my design onto 2.5 inch by 3.5 inch card which is the
average size for playing cards, printing 31 cards with 30 of the
cards being playing cards and 1 information card informing the
player on how to play said game cost an average of 2 pounds per
pack of cards, I have utilised a plastic case to act as storage and
packaging for the cards the case has a see through front cover so I
can place the first card backwards as that will display the logo
design that is on the back of all the cards to potential consumers
hopefully to entice the into buying my game and playing it, having
the front cover be see through also cuts down on product cost as I
wouldn’t have to pay for a logo design on the plastic of the case,
by cutting down the cost of the case by having it blank has
lowered the cost exponentially and making the average cost of the
case 2 pounds 50 making. for the plastic case cover colour i have
decided on red to fit in with the theme of red and gold formal
stage design that is on the cards to make a cohesive theme
through the whole game. The total cost of the production for 1 set
of my card game is 4 pounds and 50p and this could be reduced if
decide to mass produce the game, the cost will go down by
around 25% making profit margin quite profitable as I will be
selling the game for around 9 pounds, which is around the
average price for similar card games.</ins></H3>
<H2 align="CENTER" style="color:black;" class= ins>Conclusion:</ins></H2>
<H3 align="CENTER" style="color:black;" class= ins>
	I am extremely pleased with the results of my card game I feel I
have done my best with all aspects of the journey making my
game from the digital design elements at the start and the printing
and production of the card game, I feel it stylistically fits with the
theme I was trying to display, that I believe will appeal to my target
audience of older children to young adults. And now I await
feedback from some of the people I have selected to trial my
game and then hopefully, eventually I will receive positive
feedback from future customers of my card game.

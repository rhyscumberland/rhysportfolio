<H3 align="CENTER" style="color:black;" class= ins> My thought process behind this artwork is taking insperation from the album title and displaying my artistic version of it in the cover, creating a band of superheros each with their own individual instruments.

<H3 align="CENTER" style="color:black;" class= ins> With this image i incorperated a picture i had photographed a few months earlier of a protester preaching to a young man to display a more political message in the artwork, and making the image a watercolour, cartoon like images as i liked the aesthetic.

<H3 align="CENTER" style="color:black;" class= ins> This is the image my client decided on as it has both aesthetic and social aspects my client liked, there is no clear message that is displayed through the picture but the image is provoking to the viewer and allows who sees it to creat their own narrative.
